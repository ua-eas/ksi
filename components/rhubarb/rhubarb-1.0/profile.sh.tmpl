# For Rhubarb, we will be using Capistrano to deploy it. In the home directory, we will have (among other directories)
# a releases directory which may contain the current deployed version of Rhubarb and several previous verions. There
# will be a symlink that links the currently deployed version to the correct version in the releases directory.
# Therefore, we need to add $RHUBARB_HOME/current/bin to the path.
